# Database-Lab_-Joy-Student
Joy Student is a student information management system. 


Välipalautus 1/ Submission 1  
This public repository on GitHub was created for the practice work of course Tietokantasovellus. 
The topic I choose is to create a simple student information management system, named Joy Student. 

The system can be used by a school or university to manage student’s data. Features of the application include:
1.	the user can log in and out, and create a new user account. 
2.	The user can use form to submit info, and form elements are mainly text fields and checkboxes.
3.	Each user is a basic user who can login to resubmit or modify the data. 
4.	total 3 webpages will be visible for the user: Homepage, register page(that is the page1.html for filling personal info), result page (this is the result.html for showing the filled personal info). 
5.	The web application should be able to display the registered student's name, gender, faculty, student number, and address. 
	Those are the information the user can view after submitting information in the form. 

This web application can be enhanced by adding further features or functions, like provide a field for submitting student’s email address, 
The language used in programming will be English. In order to ensure the language consistency, all documents in this course will also be in English.
Hopefully this README.md file gives a good description of this web application. 
If this topic is not appropriate according to the course requirement, please feel free to comment or suggest modifications. 

Thank you!
